                <h3>Project Description</h3>
                <p>This is an in-progress project that I have been working on since early 2025 about my favorite shark species.
                    <br>Marine biology is one of my personal interests, and I enjoy doing research on various ocean creatures, with sharks being some of my favorite animals.</p>
                <h3>What I have accomplished so far</h3>    
                <p>So far, the project only consists of one basic html page with basic information and one basic css page with very simple styling.</p>
                <h3>Plans for this project</h3>
                <p>My next steps will consist of further styling the content in the html file, either with flexbox or grid, and making the site responsive with the help of media queries, using a mobile-first design approach.
                    <br>Next, I would like to add functionality to the website using JavaScript. I would like to add a search function, and maybe use an API to supply the user with interesting shark facts.
